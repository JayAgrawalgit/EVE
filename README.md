Evolve Voice Equipment
  What if we can Add Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa in one device to take advantage of both AI?
  As we all know Google has its own assistant protocol device name as google home and Amazon has its own assistant protocol device name as Alexa Dote so what I wanted to do is, the google assistant and amazon Alexa both are an open-source project so I can be fixing in a single device with some minimalistic changes.
here I need software, as well as hardware.
Technologies I will be using here as per regarding software are:
1. Google Assistant AI packages
2. Amazon Alexa   AI packages
3. Shell scripting and
4. Python 

So here You can contribute and ask me any question related to this.
